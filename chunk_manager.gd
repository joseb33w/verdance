class_name ChunkManager extends Node
## CHUNK MANAGER — resident-RING streaming for mode=="chunk" worlds. Maintains a 3x3 ring of
## live cells around the player (Chebyshev radius RING_RADIUS), builds AT MOST ONE queued cell
## per frame (no ring-shift burst -> no main-thread jank), and EVICTS cells outside the ring
## (queue_free root+enemies) — eviction is what BOUNDS memory so the ring fits mobile Safari.
##
## This REPLACES SceneManager for chunk worlds. The one-resident ZONE path (mode!="chunk") is
## untouched — main.gd dispatches on world.mode and routes combat/HUD reads to whichever streamer
## is active. We deliberately expose the SAME public fields SceneManager does
## (enemies / current_id / current_root / transitioning) so those reads stay drop-in.
##
## NAV: props are gone -> the ground is flat, so we use ONE shared flat NavigationRegion3D sized
## to the ring instead of a per-cell runtime bake (the per-cell bake is the main-thread stall the
## prototype must avoid + would corrupt the memory/jank number). enemy.gd also direct-chases when
## the path is degenerate, so a missing/rebuilding region still chases.
##
## HOT-RELOAD (B2): reload(new_world) re-parses the grid in place when the polled world.json
## changes. RESIDENT cells whose record actually CHANGED are rebuilt at the SAME world offset
## (no player move, no fade); non-resident cells just refresh their grid record so the new layout
## is applied the next time they stream in. This is the chunk-mode counterpart of
## SceneManager.reload — which (wrongly for a ring) rebuilds the whole area behind a fade
## (it keeps the player's position, but a full rebuild + fade is still wrong for a ring).
##
## FAR RING: behind the resident ring sits a second, CHEAP ring of far-PROXY cells
## (RING_RADIUS < d <= FAR_RADIUS) so the world reads as a continuous place from afar instead of
## ending abruptly at the ring's edge. A proxy is silhouette-only: the ground + parametric structure
## shells (SOLID — the "interior" key is stripped, so no interior geometry / "gogi_door" leaves /
## interior lights ever exist in a proxy) + road strips — NO props, NO GLB/network fetches, NO
## scatter/populate/NPC/chest/door/enemy/traffic, and ZERO colliders. Proxies build through the same one-per-frame queue (residents
## always outrank them), demote (evicted resident -> proxy) and promote (proxy freed the moment the
## full build starts) as the ring moves, and stale ones beyond FAR_RADIUS are LRU-freed under a
## FAR_CAP ceiling so far-ring memory stays strictly bounded.
##
## COLLISION IS SOLID-BY-DEFAULT: every placement path here (props/landmark, populate, scatter)
## gives an object a static collider when its world AABB's largest dimension >= SOLID_MIN_DIM (the
## shared 0.45m contract, world-streaming.md §8); anything smaller is walkthrough decoration. A spec
## opts out with collider:false/"none". Scatter keeps its single MultiMesh draw call and carries its
## shapes in a parallel StaticBody3D container. Traffic cars are normalized to CAR_TARGET_LEN
## (longest horizontal dimension) before grounding so a toy-scale GLB never reads as a toy.
