class_name Vehicle extends CharacterBody3D
## BOARDABLE VEHICLES & MOUNTS (v3 — Wave 3 "motion profiles + mounts") — a world-level "vehicles"
## entry the player can walk up to, BOARD, and DRIVE/RIDE:
##   "vehicles": [{"pos": [x, z], "name": "...", "profile": "car"|"tank"|"boat"|"plane"|"horse"|
##                 "bull"|"dragon" (default "car"), "color": [r, g, b], "model": "<optional>"}]
## main.gd spawns these ONCE at boot onto the PERSISTENT layer (never cell-parented — chunk
## eviction and zone transitions can't touch them). The body is a CharacterBody3D with a box
## collider derived from the composed/scale-normalised AABB, so buildings/walls stop it
## (move_and_slide) while y terrain-follows the rendered surface via GTerrain.height. While
## driving, main.gd feeds its EXISTING input vector here and the player is parked ON the
## boardable every physics tick — so chunk streaming and reach_area quest notifications (both
## read player.global_position) follow the DRIVEN position with no extra wiring.
##
## PROFILES (Wave 3):
##   car    — Wave-2 articulated parametric car, byte-equivalent behavior (door choreography).
##   tank   — turn-in-place tracks; parametric hull/glacis/turret body; door-less Wave-1 style
##            swap-in boarding (hatch choreography is OUT OF SCOPE v1 — the driver is hidden,
##            exactly the Wave-1 fused-GLB idiom).
##   boat   — rides the WATER LEVEL (set_water) with a small bob, not the terrain; a world with
##            NO water degrades to car-on-terrain. Step-in boarding (no door) + GPose.sit.
##   plane  — arcade flight: car-like taxi, lift-off above takeoff speed, pitch/bank in the air,
##            SPEED_MAX 22 / ALT_MAX 32 envelope, lands when terrain-relative height < 0.5.
##            Step-in boarding + GPose.sit. Cosmetic spinning prop disc.
##   horse / bull / dragon — MOUNTS: no parametric body; "model" omitted resolves a LIBRARY
##            DEFAULT (main.gd asks Vehicle.default_model_path). Rider is VISIBLE, parked on a
##            "MountMarker" seated ON the creature's DORSAL SURFACE (mesh-vertex back-line sample
##            at a per-profile seat z — never the AABB top, which is the raised head/crest) and
##            posed astride via GPose.ride. An engine-built parametric saddle marks the seat
##            (spec {"saddle": false} disables; generators ship mounts BARE-BACKED). Gait
##            sync plays the model's EMBEDDED clips (walk/gallop/idle; dragon flap/glide) —
##            clipless creatures still ride, silently un-animated. Dragon shares the plane's
##            flight envelope and walks when landed.
##
## BODY MODES (decided by the SPEC, not by fetch success):
##   - VEHICLE profiles, "model" OMITTED  -> the profile's PARAMETRIC body (GShapes + GSurf).
##   - VEHICLE profiles, "model" PRESENT  -> the Wave-1 fused-GLB swap-in boarding, with a
##     VISIBLE-DRIVER upgrade: setup probes the cabin column for a driver-sized clear band above
##     an interior floor/deck (open jeep, boat cockpit, hollow hard-top) and synthesizes a
##     "SeatMarker" there — enter() then seats the driver visibly (GPose.sit). Solid/closed
##     fused bodies (and capsule rigs) keep the Wave-1 instant hide. A spec "seat": [x, y, z]
##     (self-local metres) or an authored SaddleMarker/SeatMarker node in the GLB wins outright.
##   - MOUNT profiles -> ALWAYS the model path (library default or spec model) and ALWAYS the
##     mount boarding (visible rider at the MountMarker) — a mount has no cabin to hide in, so
##     the fused-GLB "hide the driver" fallback would strand an invisible rider on its back.
##
## HOT-RELOAD SAFETY: main.gd calls exit() before freeing. exit() mid-ENTER is guarded (no-op),
## exit() mid-FLIGHT is a guarded no-op too (no mid-air dismounts — the chunk movement contract
## has no gravity, a dropped player would float), and _exit_tree() force-restores the driver
## (pose/visibility/collision/position AT TERRAIN HEIGHT) if the node is freed mid-choreography,
## mid-drive or mid-flight, so a chat edit can never strand a hidden, posed or airborne player.

# pops out of the vehicle"). Two-part fix: (1) disable every CollisionShape3D on the rider
# RECURSIVELY — a rigged avatar nests its shape under the model, not as a direct child, so the old
# direct-children-only loop missed it and left the rider solid; (2) a mutual collision exception
# (mirrors the door safeguard at enter/exit). Paired: off=true on board (disable + add exception),
