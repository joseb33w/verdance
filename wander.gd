class_name WanderAgent extends Node3D
## CROWD LOCOMOTION — makes a populated character (a Meshy/library person) WALK instead of standing still: it
## strolls to a random target within a radius of its home, pauses, picks a new one — following the terrain, facing
## its heading, and playing its WALK clip while moving / IDLE while paused (so a `populate` cast reads as a LIVING
## crowd, not statues). Cheap: pure transform movement (no physics body), but COLLISION-AWARE: two short raycasts (a
## torso ray + a shin ray, so LOW props the torso ray flies over are still caught) validate each stroll target and
## probe ahead while walking, so agents route around solid objects instead of clipping through them (colliderless
## worlds: rays hit nothing -> behaviour identical to before). Movement ticks
## in _physics_process because space-state queries are only valid there. The model is a child of this node;
## `setup()` wires it. Used by chunk_manager when a `populate` entry sets behaviour:"wander".
